# Remember-the-Number
My first Unity game, created back in 2016

Created: 2016

Back in 2016 I have met Unity engine for the first time, also we could say I have met programming. I was total newbie, personally I think, it can be seen from my code.

What is the purpose of this game? I remember I coded this game while playing W3. Game rules are simple, on the display appear a sequence of numbers with different time distance. You just have to repeat the sequence in correct order. Simple as that.

Game was primary headed for phones, so build and APK and test it or, set correct screen resolution in unity. {ex: 750x1334}.

Game was alson on google play, but I have removed it.

**What I have learned**
- brief intro into unity 
- brief intro into C#
- uploading on google play

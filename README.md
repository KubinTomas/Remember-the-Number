# Remember-the-Number
My first Unity game, created back in 2016

Created: 2016
Unit version: 5.5.1f

Back in 2016 I have met Unity engine for the first time, also we could say I have met programming. I was a total newbie, personally I think, it can be seen from my code.

What is the purpose of this game? I remember I was coding this game while playing W3. Game rules are simple, on the display appears a sequence of numbers with different time distance. You just have to repeat the sequence in the correct order. Simple as that.

Game was primary headed for phones, so you need to build an APK {mobile installation} and then play. Second option is to play the game via unity editor. So, open the game in unity and set correct screen resolution {ex: 750x1334}, then play

Game was alson on google play, but I have removed it.

**What I have learned**
- brief intro into unity 
- brief intro into C#
- uploading on google play

**Demo**
